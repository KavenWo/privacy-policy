        <h1>Privacy Policy for Dayly</h1>
        
        <div class="last-updated">
            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 2, 2025
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Thank you for using Dayly, your personal mood and journal tracking companion. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.</p>
            <p>Dayly is developed and maintained by its founders based in Malaysia. Your privacy and the security of your personal journal are our top priorities.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> If you choose to sign in with Google, we receive your email address, display name, profile photo, and Google account ID</li>
            <li><strong>Anonymous Sign-In:</strong> If you choose anonymous login, we create an account with no personal identifying information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Journal Data</h3>
        <p>To provide the journaling service, we collect and store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Journal entries and content you write</li>
            <li>Mood selections</li>
            <li>Entry subjects and categories</li>
            <li>Dates and times of entries</li>
            <li>Timestamps for when entries are created or modified</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Information</h3>
        <p>To ensure the app functions properly, we automatically collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device screen dimensions (for proper display)</li>
            <li>Authentication tokens (to keep you securely logged in)</li>
            <li>Basic app performance data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Store Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your journal data is stored using a dual storage approach for optimal performance and reliability:</p>
        
        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your journal entries are stored directly on your device for quick access and offline functionality</li>
            <li>Local data is stored in the app's secure storage area on your device</li>
            <li>This allows you to access and create entries even without an internet connection</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
        <p>Your journal data is also stored securely using <strong>Google Cloud Firestore</strong>, a cloud database service. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is <strong>encrypted during transmission</strong> using industry-standard security protocols</li>
            <li>Your data is <strong>encrypted when stored</strong> on Google's secure servers</li>
            <li>Your data is accessible from any device when you sign in with your account</li>
            <li>Firebase security rules ensure that only you can access your own journal entries</li>
            <li>Data automatically syncs between your local device and the cloud when connected to the internet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and maintain the journaling functionality</li>
            <li>Authenticate your account and keep it secure</li>
            <li>Sync your journal entries across your devices</li>
            <li>Enable you to search through your entries</li>
            <li>Organize your entries by date, mood, and category</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>We do not:</strong>
            <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
                <li>Sell your personal information</li>
